# JavaScript enablement 4 Plumsail Forms developers
This is an enablement/learning repository. It aims to teach modern JavaScript for SharePoint Online and Plumsail Forms developers.
## ToDos:
0. copy the file [./src/index.html](./src/index.html) to "./src/{yourname}.html" (so you can refer to it, if something breaks)
1. try to understand the code and add your name and location to the footer element
2. instead of login successful write "Welcome {username}" and instead of login failed write "Invalid Credentials". Change the password to "{yourname!}".
3. implement the secret button feature (tip: register a click event on the secret button)
4. fetch the open dog API (https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random) and display the image in the result div
* if you're stuck:
    * try to look at the dog api documentation (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random)
    * try to refer to the documentation of the fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
    * try to understand the async/await syntax (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
    * try to find hints within the ./src/samples folder
5. optional: Add a fourth button to the form, register a click event and do something cool with it (e.g. change the background color, trigger a sound etc.)
6. show me your solution when you're done!

most importantly: good luck and have fun! :)
